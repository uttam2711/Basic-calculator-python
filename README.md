# Basic-calculator-python
## 📌 Overview
This is a **menu-driven basic calculator** built using Python.  
The program runs in the terminal and allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations in a loop until they choose to exit.

This project was created to strengthen my understanding of **Python functions, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling**.
